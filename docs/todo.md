# To-do List

This project is a replacement for PHP Mess Detected (PHPMD).

## Structure

PHPMD uses the AST from PDepend to apply metrics. Unfortunately this is a bad design. PDepend only
measures the complexity inside code units like classes and methods. It doesn't measure anything in
standalone files that is not in a class or method. PHP isn't like Java and that it allows unlimited
amounts of standalone code that is not in classes. Because PHPMD depends on PDepend, it has the same
limitations.

PHPMD also offers limited access to the metrics of PDepend.

A better design is to use PDepend only for its measurements and then use Nikic Parser to parse the
rest of the code and look for lint issues. This also enables the PDepend measurements to be cached.

## PDepend

Use PDepend to generate and cache metrics.

1. Make a list of each PHP directory.
2. Run PDepend on each directory one at a time and cache the results.
3. Generate summary statics of normal metrics.
4. Use it to reject above 95% for each value.

## Warning vs. Error

PHPMD gives warnings too frequently and then they are disabled. Once you exceed the threshold, your
code can grow without limit and not have any further warnings.

There should be a warning level (> 95%) and an error level (> 99.5%).

## Values

Update the values with vendor files (vendor.xml).

## Config File

Transfer the values to a config file and install with config-setup.

## Docs

Write documentation

## Update

Add an update flag(?) to update the cache.

## Linter

Remove extra lines from linter and finish.

## PHPMD

Remove PHPMD from config and replace with this.

## Cache

Give `check-style` its own cache file and update `php-linter`.

## Variable metric

Complexity is in the state manipulation, not the structures. Check the local variable count.

## Explanations

### Boolean function names

Booleans should all be named with a declarative verb as if they're answering a yes or no question.
So you shouldn't using imperative verb like check or validate. Instead:

-   Use a quality like isValid()
-   Check for success like canStop()
-   Express a goal like shouldAccept() or shouldUse().

### Name printer

Write a name printer for $var and func(), etc.

### Automatic update of staged/changed files

When check-metrics is run, make a list of staged/changed files. If any are newer than the staged.xml
cache, update the cache with just those files. Use it instead of summary.xml for those files.

### Caching for check-style

Save errors/code info in a cache file for check-style.

### Docblocks

Look for Docblock-type tags that are not in doc-block style comments.

### Functions

Give warning to move functions and constants into classes.
